# Utilities
These utilities are meant to assist developers working on FalconPy, the CrowdStrike SDK for Python.

## Inventory
All of these utilities are designed to be executed from within the parent folder.

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `coverage.config` | Configuration settings for coverage.py integration. |
| `create-lambda-layer.sh` | Leverages docker to create a ZIP archive of FalconPy to be used as an AWS lambda layer. A modified version of this utility is used to generate the download available on [falconpy.io](https://falconpy.io/downloads/falconpy-layer.zip). |
| `debug.sh` | Starts the FalconPy interactive debugger. Execute this from the main directory. Example: `util/debug.sh` |
| `docstyle.sh` | Lints the package docstrings using `pydocstyle` and returns the result. |
| `lint.sh` | lints the package source with `flake8` and `pylint` and returns the result. |
| `run-tests.sh` | Runs a complete unit test series, reports code coverage and runs a bandit analysis. |
| `unit-test.sh` | Runs a single unit test series and reports code coverage. Execute individual tests by specifying their module name. Example: `util/unit-test.sh real_time_response` |
