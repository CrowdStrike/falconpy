# Real Time Response examples
The examples within this folder focus on leveraging CrowdStrike's Real Time Response API to respond to security events.

- [Bulk Execute](#bulk-execute-a-command-on-matched-hosts) - Bulk execute a command on multiple hosts that you select by using a search string.
- [Queued Execute](#bulk-execute-a-command-on-matched-hosts-with-queuing) - Bulk execute a command on multiple hosts that are selected by using a search string or a provided list of host AIDs. Execution is queued for offline hosts with request IDs stored to an external file for later result retrieval.
- [Get RTR result](#get-rtr-result) - Retrieve the results for previously executed RTR batch commands.
- [Dump Process Memory](pid-dump) - Dumps the memory for a running process on a target system.
- [My Little RTR](pony) - Retrieve System Information and draws ASCII art.


## Bulk execute a command on matched hosts
This simple example demonstrates performing batch administrative commands against
multiple hosts. The host list is calculated based upon a string match between the
hostname and a search string you provide at runtime. The command executed is also
provided at runtime, and passed to the target host in Raw format. (Default command: `ls -al`)

You must provide your credentials to the program at runtime, or have them pre-defined within your environment. These
environment variables are called `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Results are output to the screen broken out by host.

### Running the program
In order to run this demonstration, you will need access to CrowdStrike API keys with the following scopes:
| Service Collection | Scope |
| :---- | :---- |
| Hosts | __READ__ |
| Real Time Response | __READ__, __WRITE__ |
| Real Time Response Admin | __READ__, __WRITE__ |

### Execution syntax
The following command line arguments are accepted.

| Argument | Long argument | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  `-h` | `--help` | Show help message and exit |
|  `-k` _FALCON_CLIENT_ID_ | `--falcon_client_id` _FALCON_CLIENT_ID_ | CrowdStrike Falcon API Client ID |
|  `-s` _FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET_ | `--falcon_client_secret` _FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET_ | CrowdStrike Falcon API Client Secret |
|  `-c` _COMMAND_ | `--command` _COMMAND_ | Command to perform. Defaults to `ls -al`. |
|  `-f` _FIND_ | `--find` _FIND_ | String to match against hostname to select hosts. |
|  `-t` _TIMEOUT_ | `--timeout` _TIMEOUT_ | Timeout duration for command execution in seconds. (Max: 600) |

The only required argument is _find_ (`-f`) which provides the search string to use to match against host names. If you do not have the `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables defined, then the `-k` and `-s` arguments are also required.

#### Example
This example will return the root directory contents for every host that matches the search string.

```shell
python3 bulk_execute.py -k CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET -f search-string
```

You can specify a command to perform with the `-c` argument.

#### Example
This example will return the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` for each host matched to the search string.

> This example command will only work on Linux or macOS host targets as this file does not exist in this location on Windows hosts.

```shell
python3 bulk_execute.py -k CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET -f target -c "cat /etc/resolv.conf"
```

#### Example result

```shell

### Example source code
The source code for this example can be found [here](bulk_execute.py).

## Bulk execute a command on matched hosts (with queuing)
This simple example demonstrates performing batch administrative commands against
multiple hosts. The host list is calculated based upon a string match between the
hostname and a search string you provide at runtime. The command executed is also
provided at runtime, and passed to the target host in Raw format. (Default command: `ls -al`)
Commands sent to offline hosts are queued for execution when the host is returned
to service. (Expires after 7 days.)

You must provide your credentials to the program at runtime, or have them pre-defined within your environment. These
environment variables are called `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Results are output to the screen broken out by host.

Queued results are stored to standalone files for consumption using the [Get RTR result](#get-rtr-result) sample.

### Running the program
In order to run this demonstration, you will need access to CrowdStrike API keys with the following scopes:
| Service Collection | Scope |
| :---- | :---- |
| Hosts | __READ__ |
| Real Time Response | __READ__, __WRITE__ |
| Real Time Response Admin | __READ__, __WRITE__ |

### Execution syntax
The following command line arguments are accepted.

| Argument | Long argument | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
|  `-h` | `--help` | Show help message and exit |
|  `-k` _FALCON_CLIENT_ID_ | `--falcon_client_id` _FALCON_CLIENT_ID_ | CrowdStrike Falcon API Client ID |
|  `-s` _FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET_ | `--falcon_client_secret` _FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET_ | CrowdStrike Falcon API Client Secret |
|  `-c` _COMMAND_ | `--command` _COMMAND_ | Command to perform. Defaults to `ls -al`. |
|  `-f` _FIND_ | `--find` _FIND_ | String to match against hostname to select hosts. |
|  `-l` _LOAD_FILE_ | `--load_file` _LOAD_FILE_ | File containing a list of AIDs to target (JSON or ASCII list). When not provided, the value of _FIND_ will be used to target hosts. |

The only required argument is _find_ (`-f`) which provides the search string to use to match against host names. If you do not have the `FALCON_CLIENT_ID` and `FALCON_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables defined, then the `-k` and `-s` arguments are also required.

#### Example
This example will return the root directory contents for every host that matches the search string.

```shell
python3 queud_execute.py -k CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET -f search-string
```

You can specify a command to perform with the `-c` argument.

#### Example
This example will return the contents of `/etc/resolv.conf` for each host matched to the search string.

> This example command will only work on Linux or macOS host targets as this file does not exist in this location on Windows hosts.

```shell
python3 queued_execute.py -k CLIENT_ID -s CLIENT_SECRET -f target -c "cat /etc/resolv.conf"
```

### Example source code
The source code for this example can be found [here](queued_execute.py).
