## Authentication for these Examples
In order to expedite sample delivery, we will be following a standard pattern for defining and providing credentials to the API. Credentials are either ingested
at runtime, or consumed via a standardized "credential" file named `config.json`. These are not the only methods for providing these values.  

> Please note: The file `config.json` is __not encrypted__ and may not be suitable for production deployments.

In order to test these samples locally in your development environment, rename the file `config_sample.json` to `config.json` and then
update this file to reflect your current development API credentials.

## Samples by API service collection
