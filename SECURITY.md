## Supported FalconPy versions

When discovered, we release security vulnerability patches for the most recent release at an accelerated cadence.  

## Reporting a potential security vulnerability

We have multiple avenues to receive security-related vulnerability reports.

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities by:
+ Submitting a [bug](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug+%3Abug%3A&template=bug_report.md&title=%5B+BUG+%5D+...).
+ Starting a new [discussion](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy/discussions).
+ Submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy/pulls) to potentially resolve the issue. (New contributors: please review the content located [here](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).)
+ Sending an email to __falconpy@crowdstrike.com__. 

## Disclosure and mitigation process

Upon receiving a security bug report, the issue will be assigned to one of the project maintainers. This person will coordinate the related fix and release
process, involving the following steps:
+ Communicate with you to confirm we have received the report and provide you with a status update.
    - You should receive this message within 48 - 72 business hours.
+ Confirmation of the issue and a determination of affected versions.
+ An audit of the codebase to find any potentially similar problems.
+ Preparation of patches for all releases still under maintenance.
    - These patches will be submitted as a separate pull request and contain a version update.
    - This pull request will be flagged as a security fix.
    - Once merged, and after post-merge unit testing has been completed, the patch will be immediately published to both PyPI repositories.

## Comments
If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please let us know by [starting a new discussion](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falconpy/discussions).
