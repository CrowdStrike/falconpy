# FalconPy
FalconPy provides a Python native harness for interacting with the CrowdStrike Falcon OAuth2 API.

## Why FalconPy
This project contains a collection of Python classes that abstract CrowdStrike Falcon API interaction, removing duplicative code and allowing developers to focus on just the logic of their solution requirements.

## Contents
Currently the solution defines a class for each service (_ex: cloud_connect_aws_), with endpoint methods defined as class methods. There is also a single _uber_-class that provides an interface to the entire API with a single handler.
