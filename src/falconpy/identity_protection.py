        Allows to retrieve entities, timeline activities, identity-based incidents and
        security assessment. Allows to perform actions on entities and identity-based incidents.

        Keyword arguments:
        body -- full body payload, not required if keywords are used.
                {
                    "query": "string"
                }
        query -- JSON-similar string.

        This method only supports keywords for providing arguments.
        Currently using a non-standard body payload format.
        Example payload:
        {
            "query": "{\n  entities(first: 1)\n  {\n    nodes {\n      entityId    \n    }\n  }\n}"

        Returns: dict object containing API response.
