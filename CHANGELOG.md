+ Added missing method: `hosts.py` - Added UpdateDeviceTags method to Hosts service class. (Contributor: @rewgord)
    - Unit test added to `test_hosts.py` to test device tagging functionality.
+ API Operation summaries added to the Uber class: `_endpoint.py` - This provides for upcoming functionality that will be announced in future updates.
+ New endpoints added to the Uber class: `_endpoint.py` 

> Deprecation Warning: Legacy API operation IDs that made use of the Python reserved characters "." and "-" have been deprecated. 
> New operation IDs have been generated for each that now aligns to the method names defined in the equivalent service class.

## Issues resolved
+ Added method validation to Uber class calls to the requests library. (HTTP 418 is sent when an invalid method is specified.)
## Other

# Version 0.4.1
## Added features and functionality
+ New service class: cspm_registration.py - Provides the *CSPM_Registration* service class for handling Horizon registration in Azure and AWS.

+ Added methods: falconx_sandbox.py - Support for the following operations have been added to the *FalconX_Sandbox* service class.
    * QuerySampleV1
    * DeleteSampleV2
    * GetSampleV2
    * DeleteReport
    * GetReports

## Issues resolved
+ Bug fix: Resolved malformed validator in detects.py - UpdateDetectsByIdsV2
+ Bug fix: Added action_name parameter to operations that require the parameter. Closes #53.
  This issue impacted 6 service classes in total:
    - device_control_policies.py - *Device_Control_Policies* - performDeviceControlPoliciesAction
    - firewall_policies.py - *Firewall_Policies* - performFirewallPoliciesAction
    - host_group.py - *Host_Group* - performGroupAction
    - hosts.py - *Host* - PerformActionV2
    - prevention_policy.py - *Prevention_Policy* - performPreventionPoliciesAction
    - sensor_update_policy.py - *Sensor_Update_Policy* - performSensorUpdatePoliciesAction
   
    - This issue also impacted the Uber class, resulting in updates to the command method within the APIHarness class.

    - Unit tests modified

> Breaking Change: The action_name parameter does not currently accept unspecified values. This is resolved in the 0.4.4 version of the package.

## Other
+ Minor updates to `_endpoints.py` to reflect operation ID corrections for the CSPM registration API.
+ Abstracted common error output code paths to a stand-alone method within `_util.py`.
